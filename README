musl-nscd is an implementation of the NSCD protocol. It makes use of NSS
modules, just like with glibc. This permits alternative backends for the user
and group databases for musl libc. The protocol it uses is a subset of that
used by glibc. This project was created with the help of Contauro Ltd.

Configuration of which modules to use should be given in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
The syntax of the file matches glibc's.

To build and install:
./configure
make
